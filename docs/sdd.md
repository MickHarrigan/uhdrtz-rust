**\Large System Design Document**

# Introduction

## Purpose and Scope
This section provides a brief description of the Systems Design Documentâ€™s purpose and scope.

## Project Executive Summary
This section provides a description of the project from a management perspective and an overview of the framework within which the conceptual system design was prepared.  If appropriate, include the information discussed in the subsequent sections in the summary.

### System Overview
This section describes the system in narrative form using non-technical terms.  It should provide a high-level system architecture diagram showing a subsystem breakout of the system, if applicable.  The high-level system architecture or subsystem diagrams should, if applicable, show interfaces to external systems.  Supply a high-level context diagram for the system and subsystems, if applicable.

### Design Constraints
This section describes any constraints in the system design (reference any trade-off analyses conducted such, as resource use versus productivity, or conflicts with other systems) and includes any assumptions made by the project team in developing the system design.
