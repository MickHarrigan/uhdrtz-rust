# Introduction

## Purpose and Scope
This section provides a brief description of the Systems Design Documentâ€™s purpose and scope.

## Project Executive Summary
This section provides a description of the project from a management perspective and an overview of the framework within which the conceptual system design was prepared.  If appropriate, include the information discussed in the subsequent sections in the summary.

### System Overview
This section describes the system in narrative form using non-technical terms.  It should provide a high-level system architecture diagram showing a subsystem breakout of the system, if applicable.  The high-level system architecture or subsystem diagrams should, if applicable, show interfaces to external systems.  Supply a high-level context diagram for the system and subsystems, if applicable.

### Design Constraints
This section describes any constraints in the system design (reference any trade-off analyses conducted such, as resource use versus productivity, or conflicts with other systems) and includes any assumptions made by the project team in developing the system design.

## Hardware Used

This section will cover all hardware components included in the UHDRTZ kit. It will also cover basic setup and descriptions of the comonents for a more in depth explination of how to use them. The components covered are as followed.

- 4K USB-C Camera
- Mini PC
- Crank Housing
  - Aduino
  - Rotary Encoder
